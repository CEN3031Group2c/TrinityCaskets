This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on a MERN stack application with a solid file structure as a foundation. To get started make a copy of this template repo for your project teams. 

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `npm install` from the root. After this you will run `npm run-script install-all` from the root. From now on run this command anytime you want to install all modules again. This is a script we have defined in package.json .

## File structure
#### `client` - Holds the client application
- #### `public` - This holds all of our static files
- #### `src`
    - #### `assets` - This folder holds assets such as images, docs, and fonts
    - #### `components` - This folder holds all of the different components that will make up our views
    - #### `views` - These represent a unique page on the website i.e. Home or About.
    - #### `App.js` - This is what renders all of our browser routes and different views
    - #### `index.js` - This is what renders the react app by rendering App.js, should not change
- #### `package.json` - Defines npm behaviors and packages for the client
#### `server` - Holds the server application
#### `package.json` - Defines npm behaviors like the scripts defined in the next section
#### `.gitignore` - Tells git which files to ignore
#### `README` - This file!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `npm run-script client`

Runs just the client app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `npm run-script server`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
